# Phishing

**Phishing** is when someone tries to **trick you** into giving them your personal information, like your passwords or credit card details. They do this by pretending to be someone you know and trust, like a bank, a store, or a friend.

- **Educate Yourself and Others**: Conduct regular training to recognize phishing attempts.
- **Use Email Filters**: Block suspicious emails before they reach your inbox.
- **Verify Requests**: Always double-check requests for sensitive information through another communication channel.
- **Keep Software Updated**: Ensure your systems have the latest security patches.

## What If Youâ€™ve Been Targeted

- Do not interact with the email further.
- Report the phishing attempt to your IT or security team.
- Change your passwords immediately if you suspect your credentials have been compromised.
- Monitor your accounts for any unauthorized activity.
